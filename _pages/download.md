## Building Nial

If there is no prebuilt release of Nial for your system, you can build it locally.

To build Nial, you will have to clone the project from [the main repository](https://github.com/niallang/Nial_Development) and follow the instructions at [Building Nial](https://github.com/niallang/Nial_Development#building-nial).

## Other Downloads

Nial was originally developed by Nial Systems Ltd., and the code of the company's old Nial distribution is available at [Planet APL](https://github.com/PlanetAPL/nial/).

A work-in-progress [WASM interpreter](https://niallang.github.io/NIAL_WASM/) is under development, which you can run in your browser.

Nial can be used at [Try It Online!](https://tio.run/#nial), but the version used is out of date.
