 <b>The Name of the Language</b>
</CENTER>

<p> The Viking ship is used as the logo for Q'Nial to reflect the Nordic origin 
  of the name Nial. On the suggestion of Prof. Ole Franksen of the Technical University 
  of Denmark, the acronym NIAL was chosen to describe the features of the language: 
  an interactive language with nested arrays and nested control structures, and 
  to be suggestive of the motivations behind the language. 
<p> A strong motivation in the design of Nial was to use "laws" or "identities" 
  that hold universally so that consistent properties hold and can be explained 
  easily. 
<p> The oldest Nordic saga, Njal's Saga, is the story of the coming of the rule 
  of law to the Viking settlements on Iceland around the year 1000 AD. Since Njal 
  is also sometimes spelled "Nial", the name was chosen for the language to remind 
  users of the importance of the universal laws of data incorporated into the 
  design of the language.
